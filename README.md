# advising@colostate

This project aims to redesign the current advising.colostate.edu
![Old Advising Website](https://github.com/MatthewJMoreno/advisingwebsite/blob/master/images/advising.PNG?raw=true)

The current goals of this redesign are currently:
* Serve as a one stop shop for students seeking advising
* A resource for students in finding other services offered by CSU such as mental counsiling, organization and more
* Have a more sleek less cluttered UI
