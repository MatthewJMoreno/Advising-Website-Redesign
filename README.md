# advising@colostate

This project aims to redesign the current advising.colostate.edu
![Old Advising Website](https://github.com/MatthewJMoreno/advisingwebsite/blob/master/images/advising.PNG?raw=true)

The current goals of this redesign are:
* To serve as a one stop shop for students seeking advising
* To serve as resource for students in finding other services offered by CSU such as mental counsiling, organization and more
* To have a more sleek, less cluttered, UI
